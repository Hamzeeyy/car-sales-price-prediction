# Car Sales Price Prediction


## Overview

This project focuses on predicting car sales prices using a Linear Regression model. Accurate price prediction is crucial in the automotive industry, and this project leverages machine learning techniques to assist in setting competitive prices for cars.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to cars, such as make, model, year, mileage, and price. This dataset is essential for training and evaluating the prediction model. You can find the dataset [here](https://link-to-your-dataset.com).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA is performed to understand the relationships between car features and prices. Visualizations and statistical analysis help identify important predictors.

3. **Feature Engineering:** New features may be created or existing ones transformed to improve model performance.

4. **Model Building:** A Linear Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict car sales prices.

5. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook (for running the project notebook)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/hamzeeyy/car-sales-price-prediction.git
   
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd Car-Sales-Price-Prediction
